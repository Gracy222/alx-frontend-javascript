# Array
An array in JavaScript is a data structure that holds multiple values in a single object, ordered and indexed by number. Arrays are declared using `square brackets []`. They can store values of any data type, including `numbers`, `strings`, `objects`, and even other arrays. `Array elements can be accessed using their index number, starting from 0`. JavaScript arrays are dynamic and can be modified by adding or removing elements.
